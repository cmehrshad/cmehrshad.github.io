◦ Proposed a methodology to remove problem-specific features of ConvNets to improve measured inference latency.
◦ As an orthogonal method, NetCut can be used in combination of other conventional inference acceleration methods.
◦ Skills: Python, Keras, Discovery Cluster, scikit-learn
◦ Published as a conference paper in DATE 2021

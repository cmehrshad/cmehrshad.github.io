◦ Data Collection: Led and organized the data collection of imagery and physiological data from several human subjects
among a team of graduate students to use for studies in robotic prosthetic hand.
◦ Visual Modality: Fine-tuned YOLO on HANDSv2 2D imagery using Darknet to detect grasp types with 80.5% accuracy.
◦ EMG Modality: Leveraged Extra Trees method on HANDSv2 1D EMG to provide grasp type probability vector with 81.6%
accuracy.
◦ Fusion: Demonstrated that EMG and visual evidence show complementary strengths, outperforming each modality by
13.66%. Deployed on an embedded robot prosthetic hand using ROS for real-time detection.
◦ Skills: Leadership, Data Collection, Python, C++, ROS, Darknet
◦ Published in the Frontiers in AI and Robotics 2024, Frontiers in Neuroscience 2022, and EMBC 2021.
◦ Best Paper of 2024 Award.

### Intelligent Traffic Analytics System

As part of a company-wide smart mobility initiative, I developed an intelligent traffic analytics system that processes real-time video streams from multiple city traffic cameras to extract actionable insights. The system performs **vehicle detection, tracking, and re-identification** across different viewpoints to measure traffic density, flow direction, and vehicle speed distributions.

The full pipeline integrates deep-learning–based multi-object tracking with post-processing modules for trajectory smoothing, velocity estimation, and event aggregation. It was designed to operate under varying lighting and weather conditions, ensuring consistent accuracy across urban environments. The resulting analytics dashboard provided key metrics such as **vehicle counts, per-lane congestion levels, and average speed trends**, enabling improved traffic management and safety analysis.

**Skills:** Python • PyTorch • OpenCV • Multi-Object Tracking • Real-Time Video Processing

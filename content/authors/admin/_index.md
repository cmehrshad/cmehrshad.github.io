      Thesis centers on vision-language models, multimodal learning, and efficient deployment of deep learning. Proposed Grasp-LLaVA, a model that combines CLIP and Vicuna to perform zero-shot grasp classification using semantic cues like shape and feasibility, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Also studies on prosthetic hand control by fusing EMG and visual data, leading to real-time, high-accuracy grasp intent detection on a robot embedded platform. Additionally includes optimized CNNs for deployment using TensorRT and proposed new methods like NetCut for faster inference and CAEN for improving adversarial robustness.
